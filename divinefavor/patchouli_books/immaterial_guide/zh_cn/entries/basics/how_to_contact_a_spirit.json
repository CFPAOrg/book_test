When time is right load fuel and blend into bath heater. When water starts bubbling get inside the bath."

Sit in bath until you think effect has enough active time. Effects of blends that intended to make you more noticeable by spirits are called auras. Nether coal blend gives you charred aura. When spirit is active and you have appropriate aura you will need to do something to attract spirit."

In case of neblase when he watches you he will give you effect 'scorching presence'."
